2. Toxic release to water waste - Dataset description:
The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) data provides information about toxic substances released into the environment or managed through recycling, energy recovery, and treatment in the United States. Annual releases are compiled and reported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and shared on the TRI Website. The TRI covers over 650 chemicals and chemical groupings across a broad range of industries. Chemicals covered are linked to cancer or other chronic human health effects, tied to significant adverse human health effects, or significant adverse environmental effects.
